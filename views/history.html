            <h2>Early History</h2>
            <p>The Duquesne Incline follows the tracks of an early coal hoist, with records dating back to 1854. Originally known as "Kirk Lewis' incline," it was located on the current site of the Upper Station. As the area transformed from farmland into residential neighborhoods, a need for better accessibility emerged.</p>
            <p>Despite early plans, financial struggles delayed construction until the Incline finally opened to the public on May 20, 1877. Designed by Samuel Diescher, a leading engineer in incline construction, the Duquesne Incline became a critical transportation link for Pittsburgh residents.</p>
            <p>Initially operated by The Duquesne Inclined Plane Company (1877-1962), the Incline has been run by the Society for the Preservation of The Duquesne Heights Incline since 1964 under ownership of the Port Authority of Allegheny County.</p>

            <p>Formed in 1964, the Society was created by local residents who restored and reopened the Incline after its closure in 1962. Their goal remains to maintain and improve the Incline as both a commuter facility and a historical landmark. Memberships are availableâ€”call for details.</p>
